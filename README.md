# Ecommerce

This project is an online store integrated with a real API, designed to provide an efficient and seamless user experience. By reducing the number of requests through context, the application minimizes unnecessary API calls, improving performance. Additionally, users can share URLs after applying filters, ensuring easy sharing and navigation between filtered product views. The implementation of optimistic updates enhances the responsiveness of the application, providing immediate feedback to users while waiting for server-side confirmation. These strategies together ensure that the store runs smoothly, with reduced load times and an intuitive user interface.
